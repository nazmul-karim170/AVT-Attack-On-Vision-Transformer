# AVT-Attack-On-Vision-Transformer
Performing Adversarial Attack on Vision Transformer
1. Please, run command- "pip install foolbox"
2. You may need to install other packages too.
3. Run "main.py". It will take 5-6 minutes approximately.
4. Adversarial images are saved in the "Images" Folder. The subfolders are empty at the time of submission.
5. We have also added "Our_generated_perturbed_images" folder that contains the images for perturbed images for Normal and Defended models. 

Please let us know if there is any problem running the code. 


		---- Thank You------
